The graceful degradation and service workers are related because graceful degradation is to create a complete functioning appication and make sure that it would still at least partially functions when the internet is slow or lost connection. And service worker can be between our app and the internet, it makes sure that even the internet is bad, the application still works like we did in this lab, when we set the web to offline, we can still load it out.
